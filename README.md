# Data-Weave-Assignment
I have attached both .py and .ipynb files of the assignment program
There are 9 questions in the assignment. I have solved all the questions and mentioned the question numbers in the comment lines in .py file.
The code related to the question is written under the question in the .py file
We can execute the program in jupitor notebook also by going through the same .ipynb file
I have attached both today.json and yesterday.json files from the assignment along with newly created mrp files that are ceated by altering the mrp's in both today.json and yesterday.json
